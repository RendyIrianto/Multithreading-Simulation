# Elevator Simulation

## Overview
This project is a basic elevator simulation written in C++. The current version includes two main classes: `Elevator` and `Building`. These classes handle elevator movement, floor tracking, and simple request handling inside a building

## Compile and Running:

To compile the program, `cd` into the working directory and run:

`make`

To launch the program run:

`./main`

## Future Additions
Planned improvements for later:
- Floor request buttons
- Scheduling logic (choosing the best elevator)
- Passenger handling
- GUI using Qt
